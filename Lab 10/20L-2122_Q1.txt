a) Path: Node 0 -> Node 1 -> Node 2 -> Node 3
As it is the ring topology, the packets go in
the direction via which the path is shortest
until it reaches the required recipient


b) Node 0 -> Node 6 -> Node 5 -> Node 4 -> Node 3
it is the next shortest path from node 0 to node 3 after the path given in the previous part.

c) If we remove Distance vector Algorithm, when the link breaks the packet still follow the 
same shortest path they followed before breakage of link i.e.
Node 0 -> node 1 -> node 2.
